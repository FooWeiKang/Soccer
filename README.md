# Soccer
Soccer is awesome. 
Ever since I played soccer when I was five years old, soccer has been my hobby.
In primary school, I was in the Soccer CCA, I play soccer with my father every weekend, and I play soccer with my friends every month.
Soccer isn't just a sport, you see.
It's a opportunity where you make more friends, learn invaluable life lessons, and much more.
